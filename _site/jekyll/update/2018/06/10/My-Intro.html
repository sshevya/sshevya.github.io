<p>My first year in Kgp was perfect. Be it enjoying life to the fullest or exploring my interests, it was a wonderful experience.</p>

<p>In the beginning it was all about meeting new people, making new friends, exploring the campus and most importantly becoming a part of societies. I joined Business Club in my first semester and KOSS in the second semester.</p>

<p>As a member of KOSS I had to complete a task of making my own website using jekyll. It was not that easy for me because I did not know anything about jekyll. But with the help of some documentations I was able to set up my own jekyll based portfolio.</p>
