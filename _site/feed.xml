Then it explained multiple variable Linear Regression covering feature scaling, learning rate, decison boundary etc.This was followed by Logistic Regression. 
 After that the problems based on overfitting and underfitting were explained, how they could be identified and resolved.Then, Neural Networks, Model Selection, Regularization, high bias and variance, error hypothesis, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Clustering, Data Compression, PCA and in the end Recommender System was discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this course was all about maths, I wanted to learn how to implement mathematical functions in python, and the only way to do this was to practice questions based on real data sets. This is time consuming, but this is the only way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Incredible Name</name></author><summary type="html">This was surely a very useful course, but it wasn’t enough to start solving problems based on ML.The course taught me the mathematical aspects of Machine Learning very well, it began with the explaination of Linear Regression (single variable), under which it covered hypothesis, cost function and gradient descent algorithm.

Be it enjoying life to the fullest or exploring my interests, it was a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning it was all about meeting new people, making new friends, exploring the campus and most importantly becoming a part of societies. I joined Business Club in my first semester and KOSS in the second semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of KOSS I had to complete a task of making my own website using jekyll. It was not that easy for me because I did not know anything about jekyll. But with the help of some documentations I was able to set up my own jekyll based portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Incredible Name</name></author><summary type="html">My first year in Kgp was perfect.

I knew that I have to work on my coding skills and Python was the very first thing that came to my mind at that time. But what else? How am I going to utilize my summers? How do I figure out the things that interests me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I realized I’ll have to start somewhere. So I started googling about random things to know more about them. I googled about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.Then,I started the course on Machine Learning from coursera.It kind of fascinated me because there were no prerequisites. It didn’t require any hard core coding skills or any strong mathematical background, just a basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra was all that was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course helped me to understand what exactly machine learning is and what are its applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Incredible Name</name></author><summary type="html">After my end sems were over I was scratching my head about what am I going to do for the next two and a half months?
