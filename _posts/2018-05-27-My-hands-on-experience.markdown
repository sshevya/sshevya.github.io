 This was surely a very useful course, but it wasn't enough to start solving problems based on ML.The course taught me the mathematical aspects of Machine Learning very well, it began with the explaination of Linear Regression (single variable), under which it covered hypothesis, cost function and gradient descent algorithm. Then it explained multiple variable Linear Regression covering feature scaling, learning rate,Decison boundary etc.This was followed by Logistic Regression. 
 After that the problems based on overfitting and underfitting were explained, how they could be identified and resolved.Then, Neural Networks, Model Selection, Regularization, high bias and variance, error hypothesis, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Clustering, Data Compression, PCA and in the end Recommender System was discussed in detail.

 But this course was all about maths, I wanted to learn how to implement mathematical functions in python, and the only way to do this was to practice questions based on real data sets. This is time consuming, but this is the only way to learn.
