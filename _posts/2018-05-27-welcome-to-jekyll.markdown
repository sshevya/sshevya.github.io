After my end sems were over I was scratching my head about what am I going to do for the next two and a half months? I knew that I have to work on my coding skills and Python was the very first thing that came to my mind at that time. But what else? How am I going to utilize my summers? How do I figure out the things that interests me?

But then I realized I'll have to start somewhere. So I started googling about random things to know more about them. I googled about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms, etc. Then I started the course on Machine Learning from coursera. It kind of fascinated me because there were no prerequisites. It didn't require any hard core coding skills or any strong mathematical background, just a basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra was all that was needed.

The course helped me to understand what exactly machine learning is. It taught me the mathematical aspects very well, for coding part I am using Youtube lectures and documentations.
