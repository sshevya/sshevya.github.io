After my end sems were over I thought what will I do for the next two and a half months? I knew that I have to work on my coding skills and Python was the very first thing in my mind at that time. But what else? How am I going to utilize my summers? How do I figure out the things that interests me?

But then I realized "In all matters, you have to start somewhere". So I started googling random things to know more about them. I googled about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms and similar other topics. Then I started the course of Machine Learning from coursera because it kind of fascinated me and also there were no prerequisites. It didn't require any hard core coding skills or any strong mathematical background, just a basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra was all.

The course helped me to understand what exactly machine learning is. It teaches the mathematical aspects very well, for coding part I am using Youtube lectures and documentations.
