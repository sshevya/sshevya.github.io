 My first year in Kgp was perfect. Be it enjoying life to the fullest or exploring my interests, it was a wonderful experience.

 It was the beginning of a new life here. The lifestyle was different and people were all new, so it took me some time to get adjusted to the culture of Kgp.
 
 In the beginning it was all about meeting new people, making new friends, exploring the campus and most importantly becoming part of societies. I joined Business Club in my first semester and KOSS in the second semester. I learnt a lot from both the societies and also got a chance to meet some wonderful seniors there.

 As a member of KOSS I had to complete a task of making my own website using jekyll. It was not that easy for me because I did not know anything about jekyll. But with the help of some documentations I was able to set up my own jekyll based portfolio.
